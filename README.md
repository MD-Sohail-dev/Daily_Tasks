# Daily Tasks — Git & GitHub Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my daily practice tasks to learn and practice **version control using Git and GitHub**.  
Each day’s task is stored in its own folder, and each commit represents the completion of that day’s work. This ensures a clear **commit history** and proper tracking of progress.

---

## Structure
- Day1
- Day2
- Day3
- Day4
- Day5
- Day8
- Day9
- Day10
- Day11

Each day has its own commit for better history.


- **DayX/** → Contains the tasks completed on Day X.  
- **README.md** → Project documentation and instructions.  

---

## Tools Used
- **Git**: For version control.  
- **GitHub**: Remote repository for storing code online.  
- **Git Bash**: Command line tool to execute Git commands.  
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: IDE for writing and managing code.

## Key Concepts Practiced
1. **Version Control** — Tracking changes to code over time.  
2. **Commit History** — Keeping each day’s work separate for clarity.  
3. **Branching** (optional) — Working on new features or tasks without affecting main code.  
4. **Documentation** — Writing README.md and using meaningful commit messages.
